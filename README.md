# MyMovie App

 MVVM project using ASP.NET, SQL database and deployed on Azure. Also connected to a sandbox PayPal account to ensure functionality is working.

 As majority of the CRUD functionality, such as create, update and delete are unavailable for the general user, only the admin role has access to these functions. 

 Please be advised that if you wish to just browse the project, creating an account is not necessary. 
 
 You can create a normal account and test out the functionality of the shopping cart, index pages, pagination, searchbox and much more.

 For those that wish to see the full functionality of the project, please see the accounts below and the description:
